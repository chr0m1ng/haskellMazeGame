# Haskell Maze Game
This game was made with the gloss library using the function play. The original Maze Generator was made by Joe Wingbermuehle, I'm using his code to generate a random Maze and then be able to play the game on an GUI. I've added and removed a lot of functions from the original file from Joe, anyway you can get the original one in the link bellow

## How to Run
```
$ ghc lab.hs -o maze 
```
(in windows you'll need to write maze.exe to run it)
